# MMCom Automation Test Framework
## Overview
This is a striped version of the framework to test an error with Cucumber 3.0

To run, use the command:
bundle exec parallel_cucumber features/ "-p prod_smoke_calc”

There are 2 Cucumber.yml files in this repo. One is prefixed ‘ALT_’
To see the 2 different presentations of the issue in question, just switch the prefix between the 2 files and run again.
