  1: "As a policyholder of MassMutual, you have the right to choose among four payment plan options for paying your annual premium. Each payment option, other than annual, costs more money. Among our policyholders, the additional cost varies depending upon the type of policy and its original issue date. A generic description of the payment options and range of costs, expressed as dollars and as annual percentage rates, is described below."
  2: "Premium Payment Options"
  3: "You may pay premiums once a year (annually), twice a year (semi-annually), four times a year (quarterly), or twelve times a year (monthly)."
  4: "If you pay your annual premium by installments, there will be an additional charge:"
  5: "If you pay semi-annually, the additional charge equals an annual percentage rate (APR) in the range of 8.2% to 18%. This would amount to an additional annual charge in the range of $20 to $43 on an annual premium of $1,000.\nIf you pay quarterly, the additional charge equals an annual percentage rate (APR) in the range of 2.4% to 23.7%. This would amount to an additional annual charge in the range of $9 to $88 on an annual premium of $1,000.\nIf you pay monthly, the additional charge equals an annual percentage rate (APR) in the range of 4.3% to 22.1%. This would amount to an additional annual charge in the range of $20 to $103 on an annual premium of $1,000."
